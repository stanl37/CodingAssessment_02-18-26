## Project Description

Predoctoral Research Assistant Coding Challenge for MIT Sloan Finance Group.

## How to run and produce plots

With all required dependencies installed, run the Jupyter notebook from top to bottom. Note my FRED API key is hardcoded within (to fetch FRED data). Plots produced in Plotting section of notebook, with PNGs saved to Output.

## Setup (using fresh Python install, uv for virtual env mgmt)

If have conda or packages already installed, can skip most setup cells.

```zsh
uv init
uv add jupyter ipykernel
source .venv/bin/activate
```
